Warlight AI Challenge
=====================

for http://theaigames.com/competitions/warlight-ai-challenge

by Filipe "ps" Cruz

* ``/_dev_notes/`` - strategy notes
* ``/bot/`` - my bot, based out of Fizzer's starter bot
* ``/temp/`` - binaries and logs
* ``/sim/`` - the conqueror engine simulator, slightly hacked
* ``/scripts/`` - batch scripts to compile and run


Needs:
* Mono 2.10.8 to compile the bot
* Java Development Kit 8 to compile the simulator


Notice:
If you're planning to use this code to also participate in the competition you should be aware that the hosts can easily compare the code sources and spot copies. I made mine open source so others can take a look, either folks learning to code to figure out something is done, or guys thinking about strategy taking a peek at how i laid out mine. Some might be using it as a reference for some feature they wished to port or support. And that's fine. But this is not intended for you to use as a base to carbon-copy, change a couple lines and submit.

tl;dr: please don't troll the compo, the fun is in building the bot yourself.
