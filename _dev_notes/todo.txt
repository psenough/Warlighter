when transfering leftovers to an enemy border which has a stack nearby decide best action (increase priority if area is critical or stack on another region if its not)

if stacking in the middle of Africa against an enemy that is not on another superregion, walk towards north africa with the stack...

if spotting a failed enemy attack from an unknown region to a neutral, set it as target for hard hit next turn

if triple bordering enemy, make sure army stacks are still being moved towards the hotstack


debug -1 on deploying to finish superregion

have better heuristics on how to handle bordering enemy regions with 1 or 2 armies, and chose between heuristics in a smart way (random vs machinelearn)
- only do small attacks when having a bigger stack
- only do small attacks when region is bordering multiple areas
- only do small attacks when region has had no change of armies on last 2 turns

is safe triple pick in europe worth it? (might just be lucky, not smart)
