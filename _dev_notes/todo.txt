when transfering leftovers to an enemy border estimate if enemy has a stack nearby (from a visible neighbor or from last turn)

dont run into walls (improve estimated opponent income) - re-calc estimate of opponent income after we have successful attack. (we could have broken one of their areas)

if we have leftovers when finishing an area, dont move them around aimlessly, move them into the finished region (if > 1) or to bordering another super region instead of a neutral inside the superregion that will be finished this turn

debug -1 on deploying to finish superregion

have better heuristics on how to handle bordering enemy regions with 1 or 2 armies, and chose between heuristics in a smart way (random vs machinelearn)
- only do small attacks when having a bigger stack
- only do small attacks when region is bordering multiple areas
- only do small attacks when region has had no change of armies on last 2 turns
