when bordering mutiple enemyborders, dont attack smaller stack if it doesnt leave enough armies for defense against bigger stack

when transfering leftovers to a non crucial enemy border with a stack nearby: dont transfer if it's doomed to fail (deploys and transfers will be less then half the estimated enemy income)

improve OZBased strategy: if enemy is stacking in north africa, either take stack through europe or go to alaska

if spotting a failed enemy attack from an unknown region to a neutral, set it as target for hard hit next turn

never move leftover to a worse place (where it doesnt neighbor any neutrals for example)

clean up attack transfer moves of 0 armies (no need to show them to opponent) - think this is fixed already...

debug -1 on deploying to finish superregion

if we have a last action attack (priority>=9) then try to break down the lower priority moves into delayer unit moves, only for leftover moves that will not border an opponent 

have better heuristics on how to handle bordering enemy regions with 1 or 2 armies, and chose between heuristics in a smart way (random vs machinelearn)
- only do small attacks when having a bigger stack
- only do small attacks when region is bordering multiple areas
- only do small attacks when region has had no change of armies on last 2 turns

is safe triple pick in europe worth it? (might just be lucky, not smart)
