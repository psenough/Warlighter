when stuck in SA, only expanding into NA when stack is over 180, not 50

also, should have moved stack to defensive position in north africa

improve OZBased strategy: if enemy is stacking in north africa, either take stack through europe or go to alaska

if we don't have eyes on SA and are stacking in the middle of Africa, take the stack to north africa (finish implementing)

when transfering leftovers to an enemy border with a stack nearby: increase priority for highest army count transfer to that region

when transfering leftovers to a non crucial enemy border with a stack nearby: dont transfer if it's doomed to fail (deploys and transfers will be less then half the estimated enemy income)

if spotting a failed enemy attack from an unknown region to a neutral, set it as target for hard hit next turn

if we have a last action attack (priority>=9) then try to break down the lower priority moves into delayer unit moves, only for leftover moves that will not border an opponent 

if going for a "enemy had the same armies in two latest deployments attack, it's important to not attack with just 2 or 4 if the enemyborders is now only 1

pick on south africa is not so good, might aswell give priority to europe

debug -1 on deploying to finish superregion

have better heuristics on how to handle bordering enemy regions with 1 or 2 armies, and chose between heuristics in a smart way (random vs machinelearn)
- only do small attacks when having a bigger stack
- only do small attacks when region is bordering multiple areas
- only do small attacks when region has had no change of armies on last 2 turns

is safe triple pick in europe worth it? (might just be lucky, not smart)
