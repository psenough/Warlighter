debug -1 on deploying to finish superregion

if we have a stack on a region we are trying to finish dont attack with just 4vs2 and 2vs1

if we have leftovers when finishing an area, dont move them around aimlessly, move them into the finished region or bordering another super region

re-calc estimate of opponent income after we have successful attack. (we could have broken one of their areas)

set move priority levels (first order, last order)
leftover moves if first order if bordering enemy, normal if not
heavy attacks are last,
light attacks are usually first
