bordering opponent, if one of the areas is bordering one of our finished super regions, deploy to stack on it (protect north africa when we have south america; protect siam when we have australia, protect middle east and brazil when we have africa)

if southamerica based and not bordering enemy, only deploy in brazil and head into africa (no need to deploy in mexico)

if southamerica based and africa based and not bordering enemy, only deploy in egypt and head into asia

re-calc estimate of opponent income after we have successful attack. (we could have broken one of their areas)

set move priority levels (first order, last order)
leftover moves if first order if bordering enemy, normal if not
heavy attacks are last,
light attacks are usually first
