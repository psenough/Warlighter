if we have a stack protecting a superregion, dont attack hard out unless there is only 1 target left (dont leave north africa wide open)

dont run into walls (needs higher ratio)

attack with 2 if opponent has 1 army (should be implemented but doesnt always happen)

if there is a big enemy stack on north africa and i have brazil and i have over half of africa, attack north africa with 2 on last action

if we have a stack on a region we are trying to finish dont attack with just 4vs2 and 2vs1, use it to improve the odds or to head into defensive position

if we have leftovers when finishing an area, dont move them around aimlessly, move them into the finished region or bordering another super region

if one enemy territory borders multiple borders from us put everything into the biggest stack to be able to hit enemy hard next turn

re-calc estimate of opponent income after we have successful attack. (we could have broken one of their areas)

debug -1 on deploying to finish superregion

set move priority levels (first order, last order)
leftover moves if first order if bordering enemy, normal if not
heavy attacks are last,
light attacks are usually first
