picking stage:

1) get list of all mega regions
2) sort by order of which ones can be finished faster, (later: for each, calculate if it can be countered, use ratio to influence decision)
3) (later: pick order can shift to make sure you always have one safe area and a foot in the most likely starting position)




first round:

1) get list of mega regions
2) calculate where opponent could be (mega regions by order of which ones can be finished faster)
3) (later: include ratio for areas where opponent could have picked to counter your starting positions, if high turn on defensive mode)
4) (later: if opponent is in fast finishing area and you are in position to counter it turn on breaker mode)
5) play
- in defensive mode, play to keep a big stack on sensitive area, while expanding slowly on safest location, until you confirm player is nearby (then reasses)
- in normal mode, expand into fastest growing area
- in breaker mode, invest all to attack into breaking a mega bonus, slowly expand on safest location




next rounds:

1) if dont know all opponent starting positions, re-estimate where he could be (based on income and direct vision of opponent + number of turns)
2) estimate opponent's income (based on number of turns and best possible expansion)

3) if in break mode and breaker mode objective complete, turn to normal mode

if you are bordering opponent, for each region {
- if opponent is bordering one of your mega regions, play defensively on that region (deploy most of it there, expand slowly on safe place if there is one)
- if higher estimated income then opponent, play aggressively (attack with all where he is closest to your areas, expand slowly on safe place if there is one)
- if unknown or lower estimated income, play defensively, hold position and try to flank
(later: long term strategic vision: if 2 multiple areas are threatned, figure out which one is closer to main income of opponent and prioritize it)
} else {
- defensive mode, determine if opponent is likely to attack a megabonus you can finish now
- normal mode, expand fast
- breaker mode, invest all to attack into breaking a megabonus, slowly expand on safest location
}
